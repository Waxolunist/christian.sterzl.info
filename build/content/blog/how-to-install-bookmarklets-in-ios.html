<p>Last time I had to debug some javascript code on my iPhone I went nuts. All I wanted to see was the output of the console. So I wrote some code to pipe the output of <em>console.log</em> to a div on my site (just add the query param <em>debug=true</em> to see the result or click <a href="?debug=true#blog/how-to-install-bookmarklets-in-ios">here</a>). But this solution wasn&#39;t as clean as I wanted it to have and I searched for a solution like <a href="https://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> for iPhone and soon found <a href="https://getfirebug.com/firebuglite">Firebug Lite</a>.</p>
<p>They write: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Firebug Lite is <em>a small bookmarklet to easily install on any web page</em>. Just <em>add the following link to your bookmarks</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But have you ever tried to store a link in Safari on your iPhone which does not start with http? It does not work. Really. Try it. No chance.</p>
<p>After at least two hours of search on the web I found a way of installing bookmarklets. You need a bookmarklet to install bookmarklets. Don&#39;t be confused, here is the link, where you will find the instructions.
Follow the instructions there and install this bookmarklet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/iphone-bookmarklet">iPhone bookmarklet, for saving bookmarklets</a></p>
<p>Now you can go back to the Firebug Lite page and install a bookmarklet there. </p>
<p>And I will think about if I should throw my little console div away or keep it but probably I will keep it. You never know.</p>
