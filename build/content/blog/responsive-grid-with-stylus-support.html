<p>I am currently reading about <a href="http://smacss.com/" target="_blank">SMACSS</a>. The concept of having a modular css pleased me and received my interest. I wanted to test the concept hands-on asap.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to overwork the style of my website anyway, I started to modularize my stylus files.</p>
<p>I began with the underlying grid. I felt that <a href="http://960.gs/" target="_blank">960.gs</a> didn&#39;t suit my needs anymore, so I searched for a new gridsystem backing up my design.</p>
<p>I wanted a </p>
<ul>
<li>responsive, </li>
<li>fluid css grid </li>
<li>supporting <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/" target="_blank">stylus</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>I found the <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry-grids" target="_blank">csswizardry-grids</a>. The system is very easy to use and implement into an existing application. That obsoletes my 960-stylus port. I will share this port as a gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/Waxolunist/5635811" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I will definitely use the new grid system in a lot of future projects, because it fits the SMACSS concept perfectly. The complete overworked design will soon be available on my site.</p>
