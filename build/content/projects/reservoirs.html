<h1 id="reervoirs-application">Reervoirs Application</h1>
<p>Reservoirs is a web application written for the <a href="http://www.bfe.admin.ch" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE</a>. </p>
<p>The application originated out of the need to create a central place where operators of reservoirs could report their weekly statistic data and automating the process creating weekly reports. Until then, operators reported the data using either fax or email. Employees of the SFOE then tracked this data in an excel worksheet and created reports.</p>
<p>This small application fulfils all these requirements. It is written in python utilizing the web framework <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com" target="_blank">django</a>. Django was chosen because it provides an admin interface out of the box, a unique feature at this time, which minimized development time to just a few weeks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reservoirs is held in the style of the swiss federation and supports multiple languages. </p>
