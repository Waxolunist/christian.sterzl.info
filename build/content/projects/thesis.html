<p>My thesis deals with alternative services in public transport in general and especially with the project BEHA, a public on-demand bus service. Furthermore, it deals particularly with location of vehicles, management of information and delay-prediction. The technical implementation of such services is of special interest.</p>
<p>First, the project BEHA is presented in the introduction. Afterwards the strategy and the methods of research are given. The next part looks at the project BEHA in detail and all technical components. A comparison of BEHA with other systems in public transport is given too. The third and fourth part of this thesis describe two physically separated applications of BEHA:</p>
<ul>
<li>BusApplication</li>
<li>RoutingModule</li>
</ul>
<p>The BusApplication is a J2ME-based application for mobile phones. It serves as an interface for BEHA and the drivers. Especially the location and collecting of GPS data is described. There will be also a discourse of the selection of the hardware.</p>
<p>The RoutingModule is a java-based framework for some of the services used by BEHA. It is used for processing of the incoming data from the BusApplication, for dynamic routing and delay-prediction. Other services like connection reliability are possible as well.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a summary and a discussion about the developments that can be expected in the future.</p>
